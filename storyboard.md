# Internet vs Wall Street - Project Part II

The [Internet vs Wall Street project - Part I](https://murlis97.github.io/portfolio-viz/final_project_mjsharma.html) involved defining the project and creating a project outline. The final message of the project and the target audience was still ill-defined. The part II of the project involved creation of a Storyboard, a Moodboard and user interviews to understand the impact of the project and possible improvements. While creating the Storyboard the target audience for the project started to become well-defined with more and more research about stock market trading. It turns out more than half of the households in the US have some sort of an investment and the stock market. 

## Project Updates through Storyboard and Moodboard creation
- The biggest change in the project during the Storyboarding process was the change in the final call to action. Instead of concluding that the Internet vs Wall Street conflict is 'democratic' and 'moral' or 'immoral' the final conclusion is now focused on the traders. The project now advises the traders to stay away from the 'trending stonks' that are pushed by the r\WallStreetBets forum by explaining the risks involved in these stocks. It highlights the difference between safe long-term investments and highly risky short-term bets in these volatile stocks backed by a mob-mentality. 
- The Natural vs Unnatural Growth comparison now fits much better in the overall data story of understanding the Trader's motivations and guiding them towards the final call to action. 
- The analysis of risks involved now becomes the crux of the project, where the data story needs to convince a Trader very well.

## Risks of Investment Wireframe

From the Storyboard creation it was clear that this was easily the most crucial aspect of the project. If the risks involved in volatile stocks could be explained to a trader, half the battle would be won and the call to action will be achieved.

### Interview Responses

The target audience for the interviews were the same as the target audience for the project i.e. Traders. People who invest in the stock market and regularly buy and sell stocks based on the market. 
I was familiar with a couple of people already who invested in stocks and cryptocurrencies through apps like Robinhood. This included my friends Sushant from R-Systems and Shaily from the MISM BIDA class, as well as my roommate and stock market novice Himanshu. 
Thanks to Rachel from the Telling Stories with Data class, I was able to interview Matt, a CMU MSCF Graduate who has been investing in stocks for 6-7 years.

Here are my key findings from the interviews: 
>- Traders understand the risks to some extent already. Experienced traders are generally risk-averse
>- Comparing the effects of the pandemic with the effects of 'Internet vs Wall Street' would be a good backdrop for the project.
>- Traders appreciate the data story and at least have some information to gain from this
>- Natural and unnatural growth would be more informative for novice traders
>- The project can force traders to look at the Internet vs Wall Street conflict from in a new light and possibly even be an eye-opener
