## User Research Interview
The users are shown the above Storyboard and Moodboard, to explain the context of the project and asked the following questions: 
> General Questions: 
> - How long have you been investing in the stock market? 
> - What factors do you consider while investing in a particular stock/company? 
> - Would you consider yourself to be a risk-taker? 

________

> Case Specific Questions: 
> - Does the project provide you any new insights into the stock market conflict? 
> - Can this data story convince you to stay away from these "Trending stonks"?
> - Will this story educate you about the risks involved with these "Trending stonks"?
> - Is there anything specific you wish to have seen in this story? 
> - What would increase the impact of this story according to you? 


### Interview Responses

The target audience for the interviews were the same as the target audience for the project i.e. Traders. People who invest in the stock market and regularly buy and sell stocks based on the market. 
I was familiar with a couple of people already who invested in stocks and cryptocurrencies through apps like Robinhood. This included my friends Sushant from R-Systems and Shaily from the MISM BIDA class, as well as my roommate and stock market novice Himanshu. 
Thanks to Rachel from the Telling Stories with Data class, I was able to interview Matt, a CMU MSCF Graduate who has been investing in stocks for 6-7 years.

Here are my key findings from the interviews: 
>- Traders understand the risks to some extent already. Experienced traders are particularly risk-averse
>- Traders appreciate the data story and at least have some information to gain from this
>- Natural and unnatural growth would be more informative for novice traders
>- The project can force traders to look at the Internet vs Wall Street conflict from in a new light and possibly even be an eye-opener
