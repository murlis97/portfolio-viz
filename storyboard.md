> - Is there anything specific you wish to have seen in this story?

### Interview Responses

The target audience for the interviews were the same as the target audience for the project i.e. Traders. People who invest in the stock market and regularly buy and sell stocks based on the market. 
I was familiar with a couple of people already who invested in stocks and cryptocurrencies through apps like Robinhood. This included my friends Sushant Malik from R-Systems and Shaily Shah from the MISM BIDA class, as well as my roommate and stock market novice Himanshu Arora. Thanks to Rachel Bukowitz from the Telling Stories with Data class, I was able to interview Matt, a CMU MSCF Graduate who has been investing in stocks for 6-7 years.

Here are my key findings from the interviews: 
>- Traders understand the risks to some extent already. Experienced traders are particularly risk-averse
>- Traders appreciate the data story and at least have some information to gain from this
>- Natural and unnatural growth would be more informative for novice traders
>- The project can force traders to look at the Internet vs Wall Street conflict from in a new light and possibly even be an eye-opener


### Interview Scripts
- Feedback from Matt: 
I like it, it is cool.

- How long have you been investing in the stock market?
6-7 years

- What factors do you consider while investing in a particular stock/company?
Diversify and get a portfolio mix which would go up over the next 10-20 years. Stocks bonds commodities and even crypto. Investing is easy, trading takes time

- Would you consider yourself to be a risk-taker?
I'm risk-averse, with your personal money you need to be careful, unless you are treating it like a job. Make sure you are willing to lose whatever you put in.

- Does the project provide you any new insights into the stock market conflict?
No, but it is good information.

- Can this data story convince you to stay away from these “Trending stonks”?
I like that term a lot ‘stonks’. I think it is important to understand the risks involved and I have not invested in GME or AMC or any of these ‘stonks’. 

- Will this story educate you about the risks involved with these “Trending stonks”?
Yes, especially the lawsuits were surprising to me. I did not know that was happening. Its good to create this awareness that if you jump on this hype train, you might face a lawsuit. Obviously, they cannot sue thousands of people. But yeah, if there are even a few lawsuits, people should know about the risks involved.

- Is there anything specific you wish to have seen in this story?
More data. I am focused on data and numbers and I would love to see estimates of losses, seeing how much people would lose if they jumped in at the top, how much people have already lost. I know people who have gained a lot, but its important to highlight the losses.

- What would increase the impact of this story according to you?
More data, more stories of losses and lawsuits. It would convey the message clearly that people need to be careful before riding the hype train. 
Maybe the losses would be new info for a GME investor. Maybe telling them would be a good thing.

Feedback from Himanshu:

- How long have you been investing in the stock market?
2 weeks

- What factors do you consider while investing in a particular stock/company?
Earnings Growth, Stability, Competitive Advantage, Industry Analysis
- Would you consider yourself to be a risk-taker?
Yes

- Does the project provide you any new insights into the stock market conflict?
Yes, it informed me how prices are fluctuating and I really liked the natural and unnatural stock prices graph. It gave me something new to explore next time I invest. 

- Can this data story convince you to stay away from these “Trending stonks”?
I was rather convinced that trending stocks give good returns in long term and not in short term.

- Will this story educate you about the risks involved with these “Trending stonks”?
Yes, there are many risks involved and I came across some interesting points.

- Is there anything specific you wish to have seen in this story?
I would love to see more historical data about prices of stocks and how they have changed over years. The effect of pandemic was nicely shown but could have been explained more. The comparison before and during pandemic would have been nice as soon, things are becoming normal and market is catching its pace back,

- What would increase the impact of this story according to you?
Historical Analysis, More graphs, More details and risks for short term and long term investors separately could have increased the impact of this story according to me.
