# Internet vs Wall St - Project Outline

## Project Definition

I'm using the two methods discussed in class which involve creating the statements: 

* "As a reader, I want to ______ so that I can ______ " 
* "I can do this by ______" 

Using these two statements, I aim to better understand the target audience for the project and narrow down the scope and the message I want to address through this project. 

"As a reader ....." statements:
* As a reader, I want to understand the unusual stock market fluctuations better so that I can assess the risks of investing in "trending stocks"
* As a reader, I want to interpret the chaos in stock market so that I can invest safely.

Call to action: 
* I can do this by gaining an understanding of the conflict between Reddit investors and hedge funds to decide whether to invest in newly trending stocks. 

The story told would involve the following elements(Outline): 
> * Background
> * Regular trader's perspective
> * Comparison of natural and unnatural rise in stock price
> * Effect of stock market bubbles
> * Conclusion

## The [Storyboard](/portfolio-viz/storyboard.html) shows the planned structure of this project

## Background
In the past couple of months, Financial News has been dominated by the Reddit forum, r/WallStreetBets. The below Google Trend shows the interest in stock market and the Reddit forum over the last couple of months.

The forum has notoriously disrupted the stock markets by purchasing stocks of companies like Gamestop, AMC, Blackberry which have been performing poorly. This can be seen the upticks for these stocks from January 28th, despite their poor market performance in the past couple of years. 


## Regular Trader's Perspective
The newly trending stocks, which are actually companies that have been performing poorly for a while, seem lucrative to traders but these are highly risky options. The sharp rise and sharp drop in the share prices over the past month are indicative of unstable stock. 
Gamestop, AMC, Blackberry, and other companies benefitting from the activities in the r/WallStreetBets forum are all synonymous with outdated technology and haven't been performing well on most financial metrics. The people on the forum are motivated by a vendetta against major Hedge Funds, but fail to realise the impact this has on the overall stock market and everyday investors. The logically-sound financial metrics which drive the stock market have been de-valued by the behaviour of the people from the r/WallStreetBets forum. The stock market is in chaos and the regular traders cannot be sure about their investments.

## Comparison with natural growth of share prices

Growth of Alphabet(Google) share prices over the last few years is great example of natural growth based on performance of the business in the recent past.

## Effect of stock market bubbles

This effect needs to be studied in data using data from various sources like: 

* [Mergent Online](https://cmu.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://www.mergentonline.com/login.php)
* [Reddit Forum WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) - contains crude content and hate-spreading language
  * One key aspect of the Reddit form that needs to be studied is [mob mentality](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/gamestop-trades-meme-investing-make-stocks-ponzi-scheme-hurts-little-ncna1257680). 
* [NBC Article about the effect of this fight on the little guy](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/gamestop-trades-meme-investing-make-stocks-ponzi-scheme-hurts-little-ncna1257680)

### Medium

A shorthand story would be the perfect way to cover the following points from the outline using visualizations: 
* Background
* Regular trader's perspective
* Comparison of natural and unnatural rise in stock price
* Effect of stock market bubbles
* Conclusion

The visualizations from the sketches above would cover many of the aspects of the story. Additional visualizations will be developed while studying the stocks data from the past two months, made available through Merchent Online and Finance APIs. Increased variations in stock prices would indicate that the chaos in stock market has increased due the activities of the Reddit forum. The expected losses can be charted to assess the morality of the situation. 

_______

## Conclusion

The project conclusion is flexible based on data analysis. The process of intereferring with the Financial Markets at such a scale could be considered democratic if it benefits the masses. It will be considered immoral if it does more harm than good.
